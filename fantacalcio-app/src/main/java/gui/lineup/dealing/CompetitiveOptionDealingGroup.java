/**

 * 
 * Competitive dealing is defined as a collective behavior where
 * <ol>
 * 	<li>dealers are initialized on a global list of options
 * 	<li>when an option is selected on a dealer, it is withdrawn
 * 		from other dealers
 *	<li>when a selection is cleared on a dealer, the corresponding options is
 * 		added back to other dealers
 * </ol>
 * with the ordering of options on a dealer always being 
 * consistent with that of the global list.
 *
 * <p>In order to realize competitive dealing, dealers must collaborate 
 * with the {@code CompetitiveOptionDealerGroup} as specified under their interface.
 *
 * <p><h1>Limitations</h1>
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>Not thread‚Äêsafe
